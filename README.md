# Prism Ark Tools

Tools for working with the game 'Prism Ark'. All required tools should be here except the tool to extract the standard archives. For that, you should use Asmodean's tool.

## PrismArcPack

Packs files into Prism Ark's standard archives. This works for all game data except those in battle.dat, as those use a separate format.

## PrismBattleUnpacker

Unpacks Prism Ark's battle archives.

## PrismBattlePacker

Repack's Prism Ark's battle archives.

## PrismEpaToPng

Converts Prism Ark's EPA image format to PNG.

## PrismPngToEpa

## PrismScriptSplit

Two tools. PrismScriptSplit takes an input scenario.dat, textdata.dat, and filename.dat (normally stored in archive.dat) and creates a decompiled representation of the game script and saves it to scenario.txt. PrismScriptMerge takes a decompiled .txt file and creates a compiled scenario/textdata/filename dat files.
